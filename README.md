# Blog Gender Classifier
Welcome to the Blog Gender Classifier project! This repository contains the code and methodology used to develop a machine learning model that predicts the gender of blog authors based on their writing.

# Project Overview
The aim of this project is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to build a classifier that can predict the gender of a blog author. This classifier has applications in personalized advertising, content recommendation, and sociolinguistic research.

# CRISP-DM Methodology
CRISP-DM methodology was applied throughout this project, which includes:

**1. Business Understanding**

Understanding the need for gender prediction in various fields like marketing, personalized content delivery, and academic research.

**2. Data Understanding**

Exploring a dataset of 2,600 blog posts labeled by gender, addressing issues like duplicate entries and missing values to ensure high-quality data.

**3. Data Preparation**

Preprocessing the text data using techniques such as normalization, cleaning, tokenization, stop-word removal, and TF-IDF vectorization.

**4. Modeling**

Evaluating various machine learning algorithms including Naive Bayes, GLM, Logistic Regression, Fast Large Margin, Deep Learning, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Support Vector Machine (SVM). The SVM model achieved the highest accuracy of 67%.

**5. Evaluation**

Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The SVM model showed robust performance across these metrics.

**6. Deployment**

Discussing potential deployment scenarios such as integration within web applications for real-time gender prediction, demographic analysis, and personalized content recommendations.
